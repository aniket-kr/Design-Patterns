  /*
   * The decorator pattern helps when dynamic addition of features is required
   * at runtime.
   *
   * Basically, all the example pizzas down below in the "pizzas" array could be
   * subclasses of a 'base' Pizza class. Problems with that approach:
   *  1. Everytime a new "type" of pizza is required to be created, a new
   *     subclass will have to be defined. If a "CheeseTomatoPizza" exists but
   *     a customer asks for mushroom toppings too, then a
   *     "CheeseTomatoMushroomPizza" fill have to be defined. This approach
   *     lacks flexibility.
   *  2. For this particular approach, if the cost of mushroom toppings
   *     changes, then all subclasses of "Pizza" that use mushroom toppings,
   *     namely "MushroomPizza", "CheeseTomatoMushroomPizza" and
   *     "CheesyMushroomDelightPizza" will also have to be changed manually
   *     one-by-one.
   *
   * The other approach is to use the decorator pattern. The decorator pattern
   * effectively makes creating subclasses to a given superclass at runtime. All
   * the pizzas in Pizza[] are in fact subclasses of "Pizza". It also deals with
   * changes in price (or field values) very flexibly.
